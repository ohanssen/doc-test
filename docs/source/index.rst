Welcome to Polaric Server documentation!
========================================

The "Polaric Server" is mainly a web based service to present live APRS tracking information on maps and where the information is updated in realtime. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary search and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web application and a server program (APRS daemon). It runs on e.g. aprs.no as a online service on the internet, but what if we could bring it with us out in the field in a portable computer, possibly with its own LAN, APRS modems and radios, all in a box, ready for use? And how well would it work without always being online with a good connection to the internet?

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
